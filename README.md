# Code requirments
Python 3.6. All necessary dependencies noted in file requirements.txt

# Description
Jupyter demo https://github.com/SergiySobolev/gradient_descent/blob/master/demo/Gradient%20descent%20for%20single%20variable%20function%20demo.ipynb
shows how algorithm iteratively found point close enough to function minimum.

 How close it will be can be configired by passing tolerance parameter to gradient_descent_single_variable
 
 Convergence speed can be regulated by learning_rate parameter also  passed to gradient_descent_single_variable. 
 Beware that passing to large learning_rate parameter can prevent algorithm converging
